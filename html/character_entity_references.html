<p>&quot;Did You Hear What Happened to Charlotte King?" is the seventh episode of the fourth season of the American television medical drama Private Practice, which aired on ABC from September 26, 2007, to January 22, 2013. Written by Shonda Rhimes and directed by Allison Liddi-Brown, the episode deals with the immediate aftermath of the rape of Dr. Charlotte King, portrayed by KaDee Strickland. Developed in collaboration with the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, the episode focused on Strickland's character and a realistic portrayal of her reactions and recovery. It was cited at the 2011 Television Academy Honors for exemplifying "Television with a Conscience", and earned Rhimes the 2011 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Writing in a Dramatic Series. It was well received by critics, who praised Strickland's character and performance. The initial broadcast in November 2010 was viewed by 10.18 million people, and received a 3.9/11 Nielsen rating/share in the 18–49 demographic.&quot; victory&nbsp;nor&nbsp;defeat</p>
